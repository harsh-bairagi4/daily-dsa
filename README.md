# 🚀 Daily DSA Practice – Java Edition  

Welcome to our collaborative **Daily DSA Practice Repository**!  
We are a group of three dedicated learners solving **3 Data Structures & Algorithms problems every day** — each.  
That means **9 Java solutions per day**, consistently improving our coding skills, logic, and interview readiness.
